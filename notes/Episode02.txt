how to make our app production ready 
  --> our code needs to be bundled, minified, cached, clean before it is pushed to production this is done by a bundler like vite, parcel,webpack
1.Not only just React make our app fast, we need a lot of packages to do so 
2. How to get those packages into our app
    ** NPM is not node package manager
    ** NPM does not have a full form 
3.NPM is the standard repository for all the packages, All the libaries and utilites you need come NPM
4. Make our project use npm 
    ** package.json is the configuration file for npm 
5. There are two types of dependencies that our app can have    
    a. normal dependencies - that are used in production also
    b. dev dependencies - that are used in development phase (npm install -D package-name)
    caret vs tilde
    package-lock.json vs package.json
    t is a file that locks down the specific versions of dependencies that are installed in the project
    node_modules  --> contains the code of the dependencies we install using npm into our projects
