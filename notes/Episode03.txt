WHAT IS JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension to javascript that makes creating react element easier. 
It is not html inside javascript.
JSX is HTML-like syntax or XML-like syntax. 
JSX is not react, JSX is different and react is different
JSX elements are transformed into React elements by a transcompiler (babel), and eventually, these React elements render into HTML elements that display on the browser.
JSX takes care of injection attacks by escaping it.
We inject JavaScript within JSX, simply enclose the JavaScript code within curly braces, like this: {any valid javascript expression}
